## Chapter 2: Speaking C#

### Determine the In-Use Language Version

You can verify the language version in use by including the `#error version`
preprocessor directive. See [Preprocessor
Directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives#error-and-warning-information).

Run `dotnet build` to see the error message.

### Implicitly and Globally Importing Namespaces

Traditionally, namespaces were needed in all `.cs` files:

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

Starting with .NET 6, you can use the `global using` directive to import namespaces globally, so that you don't have to include them in every file. 

```csharp
/// File: Program.cs
global using System;
global using System.Linq;
global using System.Collections.Generic;
```

The author recommends creating a dedicated `GlobalUsings.cs` file in the root of your project to contain all global usings.

Note that any project that targets .NET 6 or later, generates a `<Project-Name>.GlobalUsings.g.cs` file in the `obj` folder to implicitly globally import some common namespaces like `System`.

<img src='images/20250417040028.png' width='550'/>

You can control which namespaces are imported by adding the `<ItemGroup>` element to your `.csproj` file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Remove="System.Threading" />
    <Using Include="System.Numerics" />
    <Using Include="System.Console" Static="true" />
    <Using Include="System.Environment" Alias="Env" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Upon saving, changes to the `.csproj` file will automatically update the `obj/<Project-Name>.GlobalUsings.g.cs` file.

In the section above, the `System.Console` namespace is imported as a static class, allowing you to call its methods without specifying the class name. 

```csharp
// Instead of Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

To disable implicitly imported namespaces, set the `ImplicitUsings` property to `disable` in the `.csproj` file. You might choose to do this if you want to create a single file with all the `global using` statements. Author's recommendation is to keep it enabled and to change what is included in the auto-generated class file in the `obj` folder.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

See [Global Using Directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/top-level-templates#global-using-directives).

### Types vs Classes

The term **type** is often confused with **class**. In C#, every type can be classified as `class`, `enum`, `struct`, `interface`, or `delegate`. As an example, the C# keyword `string` is a `class`, but  `int` is a `struct`. 

The C# language only has a few keywords for types, and the C# language does not define any types. Rather, the .NET platform provides thousands of types to C#, including `System.Int32`, which is the C# keyword alias that `int` maps to.

The program [Types](./ch02/Types/Program.cs) reveals the extent of the C# vocabulary by showing the number of types available in the namespaces imported from the `.csproj` file.

<img src='images/20250417044503.png' width='400'/>

### Storing Text

#### `char` and `string` Types
A `char` is assigned using single quotes.

```csharp
char letter = 'A';
char digit = '1';
char symbol = '$';
char userChoice = GetChar();
```

Note:
- Some chars, such as the Egyptian hieroglyph A002 (U+13001), need two `System.Char` values to represent them. This is called a surrogate pair.
- Do not always assume one `char` equals one letter!

A `string` is assigned using double quotes.

```csharp
string firstName = "Bob";
string lastName = "Smith";
string phoneNumber = "(215) 555-4256";
string horizontalLine = new('-', 50); // 50 dashes, assigning a string returned from the string class constructor
string address = GetAddressFromDatabase(id: 563);
string grinningEmoji = char.ConvertFromUtf32(0x1F600); // grinning face emoji, assigning an emoji by converting a Unicode code point to a string

```

#### Outputting Emojis
When outputting emojis, you must set the output encoding to UTF-8. This is done by setting the `Console.OutputEncoding` property to `System.Text.Encoding.UTF8`.

```csharp
Console.OutputEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8;
string grinningEmoji = char.ConvertFromUtf32(0x1F600); // grinning face emoji
Console.WriteLine(grinningEmoji); // Output: ðŸ˜€
```

#### Verbatim Strings

Strings allow for the use of an escape sequence, which often start with a backslash, `\`, followed by one or more characters. 

```csharp
string fullNameWithTabSeparator = "Bob\tSmith"; // Bob and Smith separated by a tab character
```

**Issue:**  
What if you are storing the path to a file in Windows?

```csharp
string filePath = "C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt"; // Issue: \t is interpreted as a tab character
```

To avoid this issue, you can use a verbatim string literal by prefixing the string with an `@` symbol. This tells the compiler to ignore escape sequences and treat the string as-is.

```csharp
string filePath = @"C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt"; // Correct: \t is treated as a backslash followed by a t
```

> **Note**: With C# 13 and later, you can represent the ESC character (Unicode U+001B) using the `\e` escape sequence.

```csharp
// C# 13 and later
char esc = '\e'; // ESC character
// C# 12 and earlier
char esc = '\u001b'; // ESC character
```

#### Raw String Literals

Raw string literals, introduced in C# 11, allow you to create multi-line strings without needing to escape characters. This makes it useful to define literals containing other languages like XML, HTML, or JSON.

```csharp
string xml = """
	<person age="50">
		<first_name>Mark</first_name>
	</person>
	""";
```
The compiler looks at the indentation of the last three or more double quote characters, and then automatically removes the indentation from al
the content inside the raw string literal. The results of the string would not be indented as is in the defining code but, instead, will be aligned with the left margin.

**Result**: 

```xml
<person age="50">
	<first_name>Mark</first_name>
</person>
```

If the end three double quotes are aligned with the left margin, then the indentation would not be removed.

```csharp
string xml = """
	<person age="50">
		<first_name>Mark</first_name>
	</person>
""";
```

**Result**:

```xml
	<person age="50">
		<first_name>Mark</first_name>
	</person>
```

**Why three *or more* double quote characters?**

If the content itself has three double quotes, you can use four double quotes to indicate the start and end of the string. Where the content has four double quotes, you can use five double quotes, and so on. 

#### Raw Interpolated String Literals

You can mix interpolated strings that use curly braces `{}` with raw string literals. To do this, you specify the number of braces that indicate a replaced expression by adding the number of dollar signs `$` before the opening three double quotes. 

```csharp
var person = new { FirstName = "Greg", LastName = "Tate" };
string json = $$"""
	{
		"first_name": "{{person.FirstName}}",
		"last_name": "{{person.LastName}}"
	}
	""";
```

**Result**:

```json
{
	"first_name": "Greg",
	"last_name": "Tate"
}
```

The number of dollar signs tells the compiler how many braces are needed to become recognized as an interpolated expression.

### Storing Numbers

#### Storing Whole Numbers

The following code demonstrates how to store number literals:

```csharp
// An unsigned integer is a positive whole number or 0
uint naturalNumber = 23;

// An integer is a negative number or positive whole number or 0
int integerNumber = -23;

// A float is a single-precision floating-point number
// The F or f suffix makes the value a float literal
// The suffix is required to compile
float realNumber = 2.3f;

// A double is a double-precision floating-point number
// double is the default type for floating-point literals
double anotherRealNumber = 2.3; // A double literal value
```
#### Using Binary or Hexadecimal Notation

Here is a table showing how computers store the decimal number 10 in binary:

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |

So, the binary representation of 10 is `00001010`.

To use binary notation, start the number literal with `0b`. To use hexadecimal notation, start the number literal with `0x`.

```csharp
int decimalNotation = 2_000_000; // Note use of digit separator for readability
int binaryNotation = 0b_0001_1110_1000_0100_1000_0000;
int hexadecimalNotation = 0x_001E_8480;

// Check the three variables have the same value
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation == binaryNotation}"); // True
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation == hexadecimalNotation}"); // True

// Output the variable values in decimal.
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation:N0}"); // 2,000,000
Console.WriteLine($"{binaryNotation:N0}"); // 2,000,000
Console.WriteLine($"{hexadecimalNotation:N0}"); // 2,000,000

// Output the variable values in hexadecimal.
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation:X}"); // 1E8400
Console.WriteLine($"{binaryNotation:X}"); // 1E8400
Console.WriteLine($"{hexadecimalNotation:X}"); // 1E8400
```

**Output:**  
<img src='images/20250428040136.png' width='400'/>

#### Storing Real Numbers

Computers cannot always represent real numbers exactly. For example, the decimal number `0.1` cannot be represented exactly in binary. This is because `0.1` is a repeating decimal in binary, just like `1/3` is a repeating decimal in decimal.

Most programming languages implement the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, introduced in 1985.

The following table shows how the number `12.75` is represented in binary:

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |     | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 | 1/16 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | .   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0    |

Note the bits with the value `1` in the 8, 4, 1/2, and 1/4 columns.

8 + 4 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 12.75

So, `12.75` in decimal notation is `000011.1100` in binary notation.

In this case, `12.75`  can be exactly represented in binary. However, most numbers can't.

#### Exploring Number Sizes
Use the `sizeof` operator to determine the size of a type in bytes.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"int uses {sizeof(int)} bytes and can store numbers from {int.MinValue:N0} to {int.MaxValue:N0}.");
Console.WriteLine($"double uses {sizeof(double)} bytes and can store numbers from {double.MinValue:N0} to {double.MaxValue:N0}.");
Console.WriteLine($"decimal uses {sizeof(decimal)} bytes and can store numbers from {decimal.MinValue:N0} to {decimal.MaxValue:N0}.");
```

**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428041745.png' width='1200'/>

An `int` uses 4 bytes and can store positive or negative numbers up to about 2 billion. A `double` uses 8 bytes and can store much bigger values. A `decimal` uses 16 bytes and can store very large numbers, but not as big as a `double`. 

#### Comparing Double and Decimal Types

##### Comparing `double` Values

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Using doubles:");
double a = 0.1;
double b = 0.2;
if (a + b == 0.3)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{a} + {b} equals {0.3}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{a} + {b} does NOT equal {0.3}");
}
```

**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428042359.png' width='450'/>

Why doesn't `0.1 + 0.2` equal `0.3`?

The `double` type cannot represent `0.1` exactly in binary, so the result of `0.1 + 0.2` is not exactly `0.3`. Instead, it is a number very close to `0.3`, but not exactly equal to it.

If you were to try values, like `0.1 + 0.3 == 0.4`, you would find that it does equal `0.4`. This is because `0.3` can be represented exactly in binary.

You can compare real numbers using the `float` type, which is less accurate than the `double` type, and the result would be `true`, but only b ecause of that lower accuracy.

```csharp
float a = 0.1f;
float b = 0.2f;
if (a + b == 0.3f) // True because float is less "accurate" than double
...
```

As a rule of thumb, only use `double` when accuracy, especially when comparing the equality of two numbers, is not important. 

The problem in the preceeding code deals with how the computer stores `0.1` in binary notation:


| 4   | 2   | 1   |     | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 | 1/16 | 1/32 | 1/64 | 1/128 | 1/256 | 1/512 | 1/1024 | 1/2048 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | .   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1    | 1    | 0    | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0      | 0      |

Note how the `1`'s after the decimal point repeat.

**Good Practice:** Never compare `double` values using `==`.

##### Comparing Decimal Values

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Using decimals:");
decimal c = 0.1M; // M suffix makes it a decimal literal
decimal d = 0.2M;
if (c + d == 0.3M)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{c} + {d} equals {0.3M}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{c} + {d} does NOT equal {0.3M}");
}
```
**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428043523.png' width='450'/>

The `decimal` type can represent `0.1` exactly in binary, so the result of `0.1 + 0.2` is exactly `0.3`.

**Good Practice:** Use `int` for whole numbers, `double` that will not be compared with `==`, and `decimal` for money, engineering, and wherever the accuracy of a real number is important.

#### Special Real Numbers

The `float` and `double` have some useful special values:
- `NaN`: represents "Not a Number". This is the result of dividing zero by zero, or taking the square root of a negative number.
- `Epsilon`: the smallest number that can be stored in a `float` or `double` that is not zero. This is useful for comparing two numbers to see if they are "close enough" to be considered equal.
- `PostiveInfinity`: represents positive infinity. This is the result of dividing a positive number by zero.
- `NegativeInfinity`: represents negative infinity. This is the result of dividing a negative number by zero.

```csharp
#region Special float and double values
Console.WriteLine($"double.Epsilon: {double.Epsilon}"); // 4.94065645841247E-324
Console.WriteLine($"double.Epsilon to 324 decimal places: {double.Epsilon:N324}"); // 0.
Console.WriteLine($"double.Epsilon to 330 decimal places: {double.Epsilon:N330}"); // 0.
const int col1 = 37; // First column width
const int col2 = 6; // Second column width
string line = new string('-', col1 + col2 + 3);
Console.WriteLine(line);
Console.WriteLine($"{"Expression",-col1} | {"Value",col2}");
Console.WriteLine(line);
Console.WriteLine($"{"double.NaN",-col1} | {double.NaN,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"double.PositiveInfinity",-col1} | {double.PositiveInfinity,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"double.NegativeInfinity",-col1} | {double.NegativeInfinity,col2}");
Console.WriteLine(line);
Console.WriteLine($"{"0.0 / 0.0",-col1} | {0.0 / 0.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"3.0 / 0.0",-col1} | {3.0 / 0.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"-3.0 / 0.0",-col1} | {-3.0 / 0.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"3.0 / 0.0 == double.PositiveInfinity",-col1} | {3.0 / 0.0 == double.PositiveInfinity,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"-3.0 / 0.0 == double.NegativeInfinity",-col1} | {-3.0 / 0.0 == double.NegativeInfinity,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"0.0 / 3.0",-col1} | {0.0 / 3.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"0.0 / -3.0",-col1} | {0.0 / -3.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine(line);
#endregion
```

**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428045236' width='1100.png'/>

Things to note:
- `NaN` outputs as `NaN`.
- `PositiveInfinity` outputs as `âˆž`.
- `NegativeInfinity` outputs as `-âˆž`.
- Zero divided by any positive real number is zero.
- Zero divided by any negative real number is negative zero.
- `Epsilon` is slightly less than `5E-324` represented in scientific notation. This is the smallest number that can be stored in a `double` that is not zero.

#### New Number Types and Unsafe Code

The `System.Half` type was introduced in .NET 5. Like `float` and `double`, it can store real numbers, but normally only uses 2 bytes of memory. This is useful for storing large arrays of numbers, such as in graphics processing.

The `System.Int128` and `System.UInt128` types were introduced in .NET 7. These types can store very large whole numbers and normally use 16 bytes of memory. This is useful for storing large numbers, such as in cryptography.

For these number types, the `sizeof` operator can be used to determine the size of the type in bytes.

```csharp
unsafe
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Half uses {sizeof(Half)} bytes and can store numbers from {Half.MinValue:N0} to {Half.MaxValue:N0}.");
    Console.WriteLine($"Int128 uses {sizeof(Int128)} bytes and can store numbers from {Int128.MinValue:N0} to {Int128.MaxValue:N0}.");
}

```

**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428050402.png' width='1100'/>

**Note:**: To run unsafe code, you need to set the `AllowUnsafeBlocks` property to `true` in the `.csproj` file.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
See [Unsafe Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/unsafe-code) for more information.

### Storing Booleans

A `bool` is assigned using the keywords `true` or `false`.

```csharp
bool happy = true;
bool sad = false;
```

### Storing any type of object

A special type called `object` can store any type of object, but its flexibility comes at the cost of messier code and possible poor performance. For those two reasons, avoid using `object` unless you have a good reason to do so. 

```csharp
object height  = 1.88;                   // storing a double in an object
object name    = "Amir";                 // storing a string in an object
Console.WriteLine($"{name} is {height} meteres tall.");
int    length1 = name.Length;            // compiler error: name is an object, not a string
int    length2 = ((string)name).Length;  // casting the object to a string
Console.WriteLine($"{name} has {length2} characters.");
```

The `object` type has been available since C# 1.0, but C# 2 and later have a better alternative called **generics** that provides the flexibility we want without the performance overhead of `object`. 

#### Storing dynamic types

The `dynamic` type, introduced in C# 4, can also store any type of data, but even more than `object`, it's flexibility comes at the cost of performance.

Unlike `object`, the value stored the variable can have its members invoked without an explicit cast.

```csharp
dynamic something;
// Storing an array of int values in a dynamic object.
// An array of any type has a Length property.
something = new[] { 3, 5, 7 };

// Storing an int in a dynamic object.
// int does not have a Length property.
something = 12;

// Storing a string in a dynamic object.
// string has a Length property.
something = "Ahmed";

// This compiles, but might throw a runtime exception if something is not a string.
Console.WriteLine($"The length of something is {something.Length}.");

// Ouptut the type of the something variable.
Console.WriteLine($"The type of something is {something.GetType()}.");
```
**Output**:

In commenting out the statement assigning `something` to a string, the program would throw a runtime exception because `something` is not a string; it is now an `int`:

When commenting out the statements that assign `something` to a string and an `int`, leaving the assignment to an array of `int` values, the program runs because the array has a `Length` property:

One limitation of `dynamic` is that code editors cannot show Intellisense to help you write the code. This is because the compiler does not know what type of object is stored in the `dynamic` variable until runtime. Instead, the CLR (Common Language Runtime) checks for the member at runtime and throws an exception if it is missing.

Dynamic types are most useful when interoperating with non-.NET systems, e.g. working with a class library written in F#, Python, or JavaScript.
You might also need to interop with technologies like COM (Component Object Model), for example, when automating Excel or Word.

### Declaring local variables

Value types are released while reference types must wait for garbage collection.

##### Specifying the type of a local variable

```csharp
int     population = 67_000_000;  // 67 million in UK
double  weight     = 1.88;        // in kg
decimal price      = 4.99M;       // in pounds sterling. The M suffix indicates a decimal value.
string  fruit      = "Apples";    // string values use double quotes
char    letter     = 'Z';         // char values use single quotes
bool    happy      = true;        // Boolean values can be true or false
```

##### Inferring the type of a local variable

Use the `var` keyword to declare local variables with C# 3 and later. The compiler infers the type of the variable from the value assigned to it. This happens at compile time, so `var` has no effect on runtime performance. 

A literal number number without a decimal point is an `int` type. For other number types, you can use:
- `L`: Compiler infers `long`
- `UL`: Compiler infers `ulong`
- `M`: Compiler infers `decimal`
- `D`: Compiler infers `double`
- `F`: Compiler infers `float`

A literal number with a decimal point is inferred as a `double` type. To infer a `float`, you must use the `F` suffix.

Declarations from the previous section can be rewritten using `var`:

```csharp
var population = 67_000_000;  // 67 million in UK
var weight     = 1.88;        // in kg
var price      = 4.99M;       // in pounds sterling. The M suffix indicates a decimal value.
var fruit      = "Apples";    // string values use double quotes
var letter     = 'Z';         // char values use single quotes
var happy      = true;        // Boolean values can be true or fals
```
<img src='images/20250507035107.png' width='550'/>


```csharp
using System.Xml;

// Good use of var because it avoids the repeated type as shown inthe more verbose second statement
var xml1 = new XmlDocument();           // Works with C# 3 and later
XmlDocument xml2 = new XmlDocument();   // Works with all versions of C#

// Bad use of var because we cannot tell the type, so we should use a specific type declaration as shown in the second
// statement
var file1 = File.CreateText("something1.txt");
StreamWriter file2 = File.CreateText("something2.txt");
```

Use `var` when the type is obvious from the right-hand side of the assignment. Avoid using `var` when the type is not obvious, such as when using LINQ queries or when calling methods that return `object` or `dynamic` types.

`var` is converted to the actual type by the compiler when you build the project. A variable declared using `var` has a specific, known, fixed data type. This differs from `dynamic`, which the compiler does not change; it remains a `System.Dynamic` type that can reference any object of any type. The actual type is only checked at runtime.

##### What does `new` do?

The `new` keyword allocates or initializes memory.

There are two categories of types in C#:
- Value types
- Reference types

Value types are simple and do not need to use the `new` keyword to explicitly allocate memory. But value types can use the `new` keyword to initialize their value. This is useful when there is no way to use a literal to set the value.

Reference types are more complex and need to use the `new` keyword to explicitly allocate memory. At the same time, they can use the `new` keyword to initialize their state.

When you declare variables, space is only allocated in memory for value types like `int` and `DateTime` but not for reference types like `Person`.

```csharp
/* Value types have memory allocated on the stack automatically. */
short    age;         // Allocates 2 bytes on the stack to store a System.Int16 value.
long     population;  // Allocates 8 bytes on the stack to store a System.Int64 value.
DateTime birthDate;   // Allocates 8 bytes on the stack to store a System.DateTime value.
Point    location;    // Allocates 8 bytes on the stack to store a System.Drawing.Point value.

/* Reference types will only have memory allocated on the heap when new is used (but they automatically have some memory
allocated on the stack to store information about themselves including the memory address of the object on the heap). */
Person bob;  // Allocates memory on the stack that can point to a Person object in the heap. Initially, bob will have the value null. null.
```
**Note:**  
- `age` has a value of `0` and 2 bytes of memory allocated on the stack.
- `population` has a value of `0` and 8 bytes of memory allocated on the stack.
- `birthDate` has a value of `01/01/0001` and 8 bytes of memory allocated on the stack.
- `location` has a value of `0,0` and 8 bytes of memory allocated on the stack.
- `bob` has a value of `null` and 4 bytes have been allocated on stack memory. No heap memory has been allocated for the object.

```csharp
age        = 45;                      // Initialize this variable to 45 using a literal value
population = 68_000_000;              // Initialize this variable to 68 million using a literal value
birthdate  = new(1995, 2, 23);        // Initialize this variable to February 23, 1995. C# does not support literal values for date/time values, so we must use `new`
location   = new(10, 20):             // Initialize the X and Y coordinates of this value type
bob        = new();                   // Allocate memory on the heap to store a Person. Any state will have default values. bob is no longer null.
bob        = new("Bob", "Smith", 45)  // Allocate memory on the heap to store a Person and initialize state. bob is no longer null.
 
// Older syntax with explicit types
birthdate = new DateTime(1995, 2, 3);
location = new Point(10, 20);
bob = new Person();
bob = new Person("Bob", "Smith", 45);
```
**Note:**
- `age`, `population`, and `birthdate` have already had memory allocated for them on the stack. The `new` keyword is used to initialize their values if you want them to be different from the default values.
- `bob` must use `new` to allocate heap memory for the object. The `=` assignment stores the memory address of that allocated memory on the stack. 

##### Using target-typed `new` to instantiate objects

Starting with C# 9, you can specify the tyep of the object first and then use `new` without repeating the type:

```csharp
XmlDocument xml3 = new();                   // Works with C# 9 and later
XmlDocument xml4 = new XmlDocument();       // Works with all versions of C#
```

If you have a type with a field or property that needs to be set, then the type can be inferred:

```csharp
Person kim = new();
kim.BirthDate = new(1967, 12, 26);          // Inferring the BirthDate property
class Person
{
    public DateTime BirthDate;
}
```
This way of instantiating objects is useful with arrays and collections because they have multiple objects, often of the same type:

```csharp
List<Person> people = new();                // instead of: new List<Person>()
{
    new() { FirstName = "Alice" },          // instead of: new Person() {...}
    new() { FirstName = "Bob" },            
    new() { FirstName = "Charlie" }
};
```

### Getting and setting the default value for types

Most of the primitive types except `string` are value types, which means they must have a value.

Use the `default()` operator to determine the default value for a type. You can then assign the default value of that type by using the `default` keyword:

```csharp
// Exploring default values
Console.WriteLine($"default(int) = {default(int)}");
Console.WriteLine($"default(bool) = {default(bool)}");
Console.WriteLine($"default(DateTime) = {default(DateTime)}");
Console.WriteLine($"default(string) = {default(string) ?? "<NULL>"}");      // ?? means "if null, use this value instead"
```
<img src='images/1747390069090.png' width='400'/></br>

The `string` type is a reference type, which means that `string` variables contain the memory address of a value, not the value itself. A reference type can have a `null` value, which is a literal that indictes the variable does not reference anything yet. `null` is the default for all reference types.

You can assign a type's default value to a variable using the `default` keyword:

```csharp
int number = 13;
Console.WriteLine($"number set to {number}");   // Number set to 13
number = default;
Console.WriteLine($"number set to {number}");   // Number set to 0
```

#### Displaying output to the user

Use the `Write` method when you want to print something without a carriage return:

```csharp
Console.Write("A");
Console.Write("B");
Console.Write("C");
```
<img src='images/1747467016276.png' width='150'/></br>

Use `WriteLine` when you want to print something with a carriage return:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("A");
Console.WriteLine("B");
Console.WriteLine("C")
```
<img src='images/1747467080175.png' width='100'/></br>

#### Formatting using numbered positional arguments

The `Write`, `WriteLine`, and `Format` methods can have up to three numbered arguments, named `arg0`, `arg1`, and `arg2`. If you need to pass more than three arguments, then you can not name name.

```csharp
using System.Globalization;     // For CultureInfo
CultureInfo.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US");
int numberOfApples = 12;
decimal pricePerApple = 0.35M; // M indicates a decimal literal

Console.WriteLine(
    format: "{0} apples cost {1:C}",
    arg0: numberOfApples,
    arg1: pricePerApple * numberOfApples
);

string formatted = string.Format(
    format: "{0} apples cost {1:C}",
    arg0: numberOfApples,
    arg1: pricePerApple * numberOfApples
);
// WriteToFile(formatted); // Writes the string to a file
```
<img src='images/1747467645835.png' width='250'/></br>

```csharp
// Three parameter values can use named arguments
Console.WriteLine(
    format: "{0} {1} lived in {2}",
    arg0: "Roger", arg1: "Cevung", arg2: "Stockholm");

// Four or more parameter values cannot use named arguments
Console.WriteLine(
    "{0} {1} lived in {2} and worked in {3} team at {4}",
    "Roger", "Cevung", "Stockholm", "Education", "Optimizely");
```
