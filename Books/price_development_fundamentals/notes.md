## Chapter 2: Speaking C#

### Determine the In-Use Language Version

You can verify the language version in use by including the `#error version`
preprocessor directive. See [Preprocessor
Directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives#error-and-warning-information).

Run `dotnet build` to see the error message.

### Implicitly and Globally Importing Namespaces

Traditionally, namespaces were needed in all `.cs` files:

```
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

Starting with .NET 6, you can use the `global using` directive to import namespaces globally, so that you don't have to include them in every file. 

```csharp
/// File: Program.cs
global using System;
global using System.Linq;
global using System.Collections.Generic;
```

The author recommends creating a dedicated `GlobalUsings.cs` file in the root of your project to contain all global usings.

Note that any project that targets .NET 6 or later, generates a `<Project-Name>.GlobalUsings.g.cs` file in the `obj` folder to implicitly globally import some common namespaces like `System`.

<img src='images/20250417040028.png' width='550'/>

You can control which namespaces are imported by adding the `<ItemGroup>` element to your `.csproj` file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Remove="System.Threading" />
    <Using Include="System.Numerics" />
    <Using Include="System.Console" Static="true" />
    <Using Include="System.Environment" Alias="Env" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

Upon saving, changes to the `.csproj` file will automatically update the `obj/<Project-Name>.GlobalUsings.g.cs` file.

In the section above, the `System.Console` namespace is imported as a static class, allowing you to call its methods without specifying the class name. 

```csharp
// Instead of Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

To disable implicitly imported namespaces, set the `ImplicitUsings` property to `disable` in the `.csproj` file. You might choose to do this if you want to create a single file with all the `global using` statements. Author's recommendation is to keep it enabled and to change what is included in the auto-generated class file in the `obj` folder.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>disable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

See [Global Using Directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/top-level-templates#global-using-directives).

### Types vs Classes

The term **type** is often confused with **class**. In C#, every type can be classified as `class`, `enum`, `struct`, `interface`, or `delegate`. As an example, the C# keyword `string` is a `class`, but  `int` is a `struct`. 

The C# language only has a few keywords for types, and the C# language does not define any types. Rather, the .NET platform provides thousands of types to C#, including `System.Int32`, which is the C# keyword alias that `int` maps to.

The program [Types](./ch02/Types/Program.cs) reveals the extent of the C# vocabulary by showing the number of types available in the namespaces imported from the `.csproj` file.

### Storing Text

#### `char` and `string` Types
A `char` is assigned using single quotes.

```csharp
char letter = 'A';
char digit = '1';
char symbol = '$';
char userChoice = GetChar();
```

Note:
- Some chars, such as the Egyptian hieroglyph A002 (U+13001), need two `System.Char` values to represent them. This is called a surrogate pair.
- Do not always assume one `char` equals one letter!

A `string` is assigned using double quotes.

```csharp
string firstName = "Bob";
string lastName = "Smith";
string phoneNumber = "(215) 555-4256";
string horizontalLine = new('-', 50); // 50 dashes, assigning a string returned from the string class constructor
string address = GetAddressFromDatabase(id: 563);
string grinningEmoji = char.ConvertFromUtf32(0x1F600); // grinning face emoji, assigning an emoji by converting a Unicode code point to a string

```

#### Outputting Emojis
When outputting emojis, you must set the output encoding to UTF-8. This is done by setting the `Console.OutputEncoding` property to `System.Text.Encoding.UTF8`.

```csharp
Console.OutputEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8;
string grinningEmoji = char.ConvertFromUtf32(0x1F600); // grinning face emoji
Console.WriteLine(grinningEmoji); // Output: ðŸ˜€
```

#### Verbatim Strings

Strings allow for the use of an escape sequence, which often start with a backslash, `\`, followed by one or more characters. 

```csharp
string fullNameWithTabSeparator = "Bob\tSmith"; // Bob and Smith separated by a tab character
```

**Issue:**  
What if you are storing the path to a file in Windows?

```csharp
string filePath = "C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt"; // Issue: \t is interpreted as a tab character
```

To avoid this issue, you can use a verbatim string literal by prefixing the string with an `@` symbol. This tells the compiler to ignore escape sequences and treat the string as-is.

```csharp
string filePath = @"C:\televisions\sony\bravia.txt"; // Correct: \t is treated as a backslash followed by a t
```

> **Note**: With C# 13 and later, you can represent the ESC character (Unicode U+001B) using the `\e` escape sequence.

```csharp
// C# 13 and later
char esc = '\e'; // ESC character
// C# 12 and earlier
char esc = '\u001b'; // ESC character
```

#### Raw String Literals

Raw string literals, introduced in C# 11, allow you to create multi-line strings without needing to escape characters. This makes it useful to define literals containing other languages like XML, HTML, or JSON.

```csharp
string xml = """
	<person age="50">
		<first_name>Mark</first_name>
	</person>
	""";
```
The compiler looks at the indentation of the last three or more double quote characters, and then automatically removes the indentation from al
the content inside the raw string literal. The results of the string would not be indented as is in the defining code but, instead, will be aligned with the left margin.

**Result**: 

```xml
<person age="50">
	<first_name>Mark</first_name>
</person>
```

If the end three double quotes are aligned with the left margin, then the indentation would not be removed.

```csharp
string xml = """
	<person age="50">
		<first_name>Mark</first_name>
	</person>
""";
```

**Result**:

```xml
	<person age="50">
		<first_name>Mark</first_name>
	</person>
```

**Why three *or more* double quote characters?**

If the content itself has three double quotes, you can use four double quotes to indicate the start and end of the string. Where the content has four double quotes, you can use five double quotes, and so on. 

#### Raw Interpolated String Literals

You can mix interpolated strings that use curly braces `{}` with raw string literals. To do this, you specify the number of braces that indicate a replaced expression by adding the number of dollar signs `$` before the opening three double quotes. 

```csharp
var person = new { FirstName = "Greg", LastName = "Tate" };
string json = $$"""
	{
		"first_name": "{{person.FirstName}}",
		"last_name": "{{person.LastName}}"
	}
	""";
```

**Result**:

```json
{
	"first_name": "Greg",
	"last_name": "Tate"
}
```

The number of dollar signs tells the compiler how many braces are needed to become recognized as an interpolated expression.

### Storing Numbers

#### Storing Whole Numbers

The following code demonstrates how to store number literals:

```csharp
// An unsigned integer is a positive whole number or 0
uint naturalNumber = 23;

// An integer is a negative number or positive whole number or 0
int integerNumber = -23;

// A float is a single-precision floating-point number
// The F or f suffix makes the value a float literal
// The suffix is required to compile
float realNumber = 2.3f;

// A double is a double-precision floating-point number
// double is the default type for floating-point literals
double anotherRealNumber = 2.3; // A double literal value
```
#### Using Binary or Hexadecimal Notation

Here is a table showing how computers store the decimal number 10 in binary:

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   |

So, the binary representation of 10 is `00001010`.

To use binary notation, start the number literal with `0b`. To use hexadecimal notation, start the number literal with `0x`.

```csharp
int decimalNotation = 2_000_000; // Note use of digit separator for readability
int binaryNotation = 0b_0001_1110_1000_0100_1000_0000;
int hexadecimalNotation = 0x_001E_8480;

// Check the three variables have the same value
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation == binaryNotation}"); // True
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation == hexadecimalNotation}"); // True

// Output the variable values in decimal.
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation:N0}"); // 2,000,000
Console.WriteLine($"{binaryNotation:N0}"); // 2,000,000
Console.WriteLine($"{hexadecimalNotation:N0}"); // 2,000,000

// Output the variable values in hexadecimal.
Console.WriteLine($"{decimalNotation:X}"); // 1E8400
Console.WriteLine($"{binaryNotation:X}"); // 1E8400
Console.WriteLine($"{hexadecimalNotation:X}"); // 1E8400
```

**Output:**

#### Storing Real Numbers

Computers cannot always represent real numbers exactly. For example, the decimal number `0.1` cannot be represented exactly in binary. This is because `0.1` is a repeating decimal in binary, just like `1/3` is a repeating decimal in decimal.

Most programming languages implement the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, introduced in 1985.

The following table shows how the number `12.75` is represented in binary:

| 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |     | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 | 1/16 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | .   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0    |

Note the bits with the value `1` in the 8, 4, 1/2, and 1/4 columns.

8 + 4 + 0.5 + 0.25 = 12.75

So, `12.75` in decimal notation is `000011.1100` in binary notation.

In this case, `12.75`  can be exactly represented in binary. However, most numbers can't.

#### Exploring Number Sizes
Use the `sizeof` operator to determine the size of a type in bytes.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"int uses {sizeof(int)} bytes and can store numbers from {int.MinValue:N0} to {int.MaxValue:N0}.");
Console.WriteLine($"double uses {sizeof(double)} bytes and can store numbers from {double.MinValue:N0} to {double.MaxValue:N0}.");
Console.WriteLine($"decimal uses {sizeof(decimal)} bytes and can store numbers from {decimal.MinValue:N0} to {decimal.MaxValue:N0}.");
```

**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428041745.png' width='1200'/>

An `int` uses 4 bytes and can store positive or negative numbers up to about 2 billion. A `double` uses 8 bytes and can store much bigger values. A `decimal` uses 16 bytes and can store very large numbers, but not as big as a `double`. 

#### Comparing Double and Decimal Types

##### Comparing `double` Values

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Using doubles:");
double a = 0.1;
double b = 0.2;
if (a + b == 0.3)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{a} + {b} equals {0.3}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{a} + {b} does NOT equal {0.3}");
}
```

**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428042359.png' width='450'/>

Why doesn't `0.1 + 0.2` equal `0.3`?

The `double` type cannot represent `0.1` exactly in binary, so the result of `0.1 + 0.2` is not exactly `0.3`. Instead, it is a number very close to `0.3`, but not exactly equal to it.

If you were to try values, like `0.1 + 0.3 == 0.4`, you would find that it does equal `0.4`. This is because `0.3` can be represented exactly in binary.

You can compare real numbers using the `float` type, which is less accurate than the `double` type, and the result would be `true`, but only b ecause of that lower accuracy.

```csharp
float a = 0.1f;
float b = 0.2f;
if (a + b == 0.3f) // True because float is less "accurate" than double
...
```

As a rule of thumb, only use `double` when accuracy, especially when comparing the equality of two numbers, is not important. 

The problem in the preceeding code deals with how the computer stores `0.1` in binary notation:


| 4   | 2   | 1   |     | 1/2 | 1/4 | 1/8 | 1/16 | 1/32 | 1/64 | 1/128 | 1/256 | 1/512 | 1/1024 | 1/2048 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | .   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1    | 1    | 0    | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0      | 0      |

Note how the `1`'s after the decimal point repeat.

**Good Practice:** Never compare `double` values using `==`.

##### Comparing Decimal Values

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Using decimals:");
decimal c = 0.1M; // M suffix makes it a decimal literal
decimal d = 0.2M;
if (c + d == 0.3M)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{c} + {d} equals {0.3M}");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{c} + {d} does NOT equal {0.3M}");
}
```
**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428043523.png' width='450'/>

The `decimal` type can represent `0.1` exactly in binary, so the result of `0.1 + 0.2` is exactly `0.3`.

**Good Practice:** Use `int` for whole numbers, `double` that will not be compared with `==`, and `decimal` for money, engineering, and wherever the accuracy of a real number is important.

#### Special Real Numbers

The `float` and `double` have some useful special values:
- `NaN`: represents "Not a Number". This is the result of dividing zero by zero, or taking the square root of a negative number.
- `Epsilon`: the smallest number that can be stored in a `float` or `double` that is not zero. This is useful for comparing two numbers to see if they are "close enough" to be considered equal.
- `PostiveInfinity`: represents positive infinity. This is the result of dividing a positive number by zero.
- `NegativeInfinity`: represents negative infinity. This is the result of dividing a negative number by zero.

```csharp
#region Special float and double values
Console.WriteLine($"double.Epsilon: {double.Epsilon}"); // 4.94065645841247E-324
Console.WriteLine($"double.Epsilon to 324 decimal places: {double.Epsilon:N324}"); // 0.
Console.WriteLine($"double.Epsilon to 330 decimal places: {double.Epsilon:N330}"); // 0.
const int col1 = 37; // First column width
const int col2 = 6; // Second column width
string line = new string('-', col1 + col2 + 3);
Console.WriteLine(line);
Console.WriteLine($"{"Expression",-col1} | {"Value",col2}");
Console.WriteLine(line);
Console.WriteLine($"{"double.NaN",-col1} | {double.NaN,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"double.PositiveInfinity",-col1} | {double.PositiveInfinity,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"double.NegativeInfinity",-col1} | {double.NegativeInfinity,col2}");
Console.WriteLine(line);
Console.WriteLine($"{"0.0 / 0.0",-col1} | {0.0 / 0.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"3.0 / 0.0",-col1} | {3.0 / 0.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"-3.0 / 0.0",-col1} | {-3.0 / 0.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"3.0 / 0.0 == double.PositiveInfinity",-col1} | {3.0 / 0.0 == double.PositiveInfinity,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"-3.0 / 0.0 == double.NegativeInfinity",-col1} | {-3.0 / 0.0 == double.NegativeInfinity,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"0.0 / 3.0",-col1} | {0.0 / 3.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine($"{"0.0 / -3.0",-col1} | {0.0 / -3.0,col2}");
Console.WriteLine(line);
#endregion
```

**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428045236' width='1100.png'/>

Things to note:
- `NaN` outputs as `NaN`.
- `PositiveInfinity` outputs as `âˆž`.
- `NegativeInfinity` outputs as `-âˆž`.
- Zero divided by any positive real number is zero.
- Zero divided by any negative real number is negative zero.
- `Epsilon` is slightly less than `5E-324` represented in scientific notation. This is the smallest number that can be stored in a `double` that is not zero.

#### New Number Types and Unsafe Code

The `System.Half` type was introduced in .NET 5. Like `float` and `double`, it can store real numbers, but normally only uses 2 bytes of memory. This is useful for storing large arrays of numbers, such as in graphics processing.

The `System.Int128` and `System.UInt128` types were introduced in .NET 7. These types can store very large whole numbers and normally use 16 bytes of memory. This is useful for storing large numbers, such as in cryptography.

For these number types, the `sizeof` operator can be used to determine the size of the type in bytes.

```csharp
unsafe
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Half uses {sizeof(Half)} bytes and can store numbers from {Half.MinValue:N0} to {Half.MaxValue:N0}.");
    Console.WriteLine($"Int128 uses {sizeof(Int128)} bytes and can store numbers from {Int128.MinValue:N0} to {Int128.MaxValue:N0}.");
}

```

**Output**:  
<img src='images/20250428050402.png' width='1100'/>

**Note:**: To run unsafe code, you need to set the `AllowUnsafeBlocks` property to `true` in the `.csproj` file.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
    <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
See [Unsafe Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/unsafe-code) for more information.
